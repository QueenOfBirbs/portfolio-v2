so for some reason github hates me on this particular project and keeps displaying the read.me instead of the actual html so here's the budget version so i don't go mental from trying to fix it:

DIFFERENCES FROM V1:
- it's even prettier
- not retro vibed
- fun css effects and such
- added new project links
- added links to social media and such

WHAT I DIDN'T PUT:
- my face/photo (as you can imagine, my name already limits my hiring prospects bc people suck, so i don't put my piercing/weird hair on display to ruin my chances more; this they have to worry about my skills and realize their biases were BS when they see me in an interview lol)
- a resume (mine is retail based and i have no clue how a tech one is supposed to be written, i'm just gonna do it after the course so i don't miss anything bc that's easier)
